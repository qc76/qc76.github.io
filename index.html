	<p> I went to Australia in 1997 for my bachelor study, and 
	graduated from University of Wollonglong in 2000 with Bachelor of 
	Computer Science and Bachelor of Mathematics.
	I continued my bachelor study in University of New South Wales as an honours
	student and graudated with Bachelor of Computer Science (the first
	class honours) in 2001.  I pursued my PhD research in compiler optimization 
	and received the degree in 2006. </p>


	<p> I joined Intel Labs Barcelona as a senior research scientist in 2005 and particpated
	projects related to compiler optimization, power-efficient CPU microarchitecture 
	and programmable accelerators. I became a people manager and technical lead of 6 
	researchers in 2010. The team was working  
	emerging memory technologies such as 3D XPoint, eDRAM and STTRAM for Intel's Skylake client 
	and server systems and beyond. I was the architecture performance owner of Intel's 3D XPoint server chip.
	</p>

	<p> I joined Hewlett Packard Labs in Palo Alto in 2015 after Intel closed the lab in Barcelona. 
	I am currently working on different performance improvement techniques for The Machine such
        as memory side accelerator and architecture techniques to hide or reduce the memory latency.

    	<h2>Work Experience</h2>

	<p>I am working on The Machine (TM) architecture in Hewlett Packard Labs since I joined the labs in January 2015. 
	The Machine is a rack scale
	system with 320TB globally addressable memory pool. I am working on three topics: (1) the design and implemenation
	of memory-side accelerator for a rack-sacle system; (2) the performance characterization of HPC, Big Data and Spark-based
	workloads for TM; and (3) the architecture techniques to improve latency and bandwith of the memory fabric subsystem in TM.</p>

	<p>I led a team of 6 researchers in Intel Labs Barcelona between 2010-2014<label for="sn-extensive-use-of-sidenotes" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">
	</label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-extensive-use-of-sidenotes" class="margin-toggle"/>
	<span class="sidenote"> None of my work during this period is published externally. The work was either published 
	internally or filed/issued as patents. Please see the patent section below.</span>.  
	We were working on the client and server
	platforms based on emerging memory technologies.
	My technical work includes (1) path finding with product groups to 
	define Crystal Ridge server 
	system; (2) performance owner of 3D XPoint-based memory controller and path finding for 2nd generation of 3D XPoint;
	(3) path finding with Intel's component research group to define STTRAM-based computer system; and (4) 
	the design and implementation of a set of large cache management techniques for high bandwidth memory technologies such
	as eDRAM, wideIO2 and HBM. 
	</p>

	<p>I worked as a researcher in Intel Labs Barcelona between 2005-2009. I participated two research projects. The first 
	one was to design a power and thermal-aware microprocessor. I proposed and implemented several CPU microarchitecture 
	techniques such as thread migration, critical thread identificaiton and software-hardware co-designed steering techniques 
	for a clustered processor. The whole project won a Spanish technology award in 2008. The second project was to design 
	a programmable accelerator. I was the chief architect, and the accelerator was one of candidates for a video processor 
	being incorporated into Intel's Merrifield SoC.

    	<h2>Education</h2>
	<p>I did my PhD in University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia, between 2002-2006. The thesis title is profile-guided 
	redundancy elimination. The key contribution is the design and implemenation of a computionally optimal profile-guided 
	partial redundancy elimination (PRE). This is the first computionally optimal profile-guided PRE algorithm.</p>

	<p>I obtained my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (1st class Honours) from University of New South Wales in 2002. 
	The title of Honours thesis is speculative partial redundancy elimination in dynamic compilation. I got my Bachelor
	of Mathematics and Bachelor of Computer Science (the double degree) from University of Wollongong in 2000</p>

    	<h2>Software Development Skills</h2>
		<p>I spent past 10 years mostly working on the proprietary softwares such as Intel's production compiler 
		and Intel's in-house x86 and graphic performance and functional simulators. </p>

		<p>Now I am going to keep my own open source codes in <a href="https:/github.com/qc76">github</a>. </p>
