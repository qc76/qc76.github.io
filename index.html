	<p> I went to Australia in 1997 for my bachelor study, and 
	graduated from University of Wollonglong in 2000 with Bachelor of 
	Computer Science and Bachelor of Mathematics.
	I continued my bachelor study in University of New South Wales as an honours
	student and graudated with Bachelor of Computer Science (the first
	class honours) in 2001.  I pursued my PhD research in compiler optimization 
	and received the degree in 2006. </p>


	<p> I joined Intel Labs Barcelona as a senior research scientist in 2005 and particpated
	projects related to compiler optimization, power-efficient CPU microarchitecture 
	and programmable accelerators. I became a people manager and technical lead of 6 
	researchers in 2010. The team was working  
	emerging memory technologies such as 3D XPoint, eDRAM and STTRAM for Intel's Skylake client 
	and server systems and beyond. I was the architecture performance owner of Intel's 3D XPoint server chip.
	</p>

	<p> I joined Hewlett Packard Labs in Palo Alto in 2015 after Intel closed the lab in Barcelona. 
	I am currently working on different performance improvement techniques for The Machine such
        as memory side accelerator and architecture techniques to hide or reduce the memory latency.
