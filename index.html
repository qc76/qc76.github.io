	<p> I am working in Apple as a SoC architect now. In the past, I worked in Hewlett Packard Labs (Palo Alto) for almost two years. The 
	key focus at that time was to improve performance and power efficiency for a Gen-Z based rack-scale system called The Machine. 

	<p> I received Bachelor of Computer Science and Bachelor of Mathematics from University of Wollongong (Australia) in 2000 and Bachelor
	of Computer Science (the first class honours) from University of New South Wales (Australia) in 2001. I did my PhD research on compiler 
    optimization and received a PhD in Computer Science from University of New South Wales in 2006.
	</p>

	<p> I joined Intel Labs Barcelona as a senior research scientist in 2005 and particpated
	projects related to compiler optimization, power-efficient CPU microarchitecture 
	and programmable accelerators. I became a people manager and technical lead of 6 
	researchers in 2010. The team was working on
	emerging memory technologies such as 3D XPoint, eDRAM and STTRAM for Intel's Skylake client 
	and server systems and beyond. I was the architecture performance owner of Intel's 3D XPoint server chip.

    	<h2>Work Experience</h2>

	<p> I am working in Apple as a SoC architect now.</p>

	<p>I worked on The Machine (TM) architecture in Hewlett Packard Labs for almost two years after I joined the labs in January 2015. 
	The Machine is a rack scale
	system with 320TB globally addressable memory pool. I was working on three topics: (1) the design and implemenation
	of memory-side accelerator for a rack-sacle system; (2) the performance characterization of HPC, Big Data and Spark-based
	workloads for TM; and (3) the architecture techniques to improve latency and bandwith for the memory fabric subsystem in TM.</p>

	<p>I led a team of 6 researchers in Intel Labs Barcelona between 2010-2014<label for="sn-extensive-use-of-sidenotes" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">
	</label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-extensive-use-of-sidenotes" class="margin-toggle"/>
	<span class="sidenote"> None of my work during this period is published externally. The work was either published 
	internally or filed/issued as patents. Please see the patent section below.</span>.  
	We were working on the client and server
	platforms based on emerging memory technologies.
	My technical work included (1) path finding with product groups to 
	define Crystal Ridge server 
	system; (2) performance owner of 3D XPoint-based memory controller and path finding for 2nd generation of 3D XPoint;
	(3) path finding with Intel's component research group to define STTRAM-based computer system; and (4) 
	the design and implementation of a set of large cache management techniques for high bandwidth memory technologies such
	as eDRAM and wideIO2.
	</p>

	<p>I worked as a researcher in Intel Labs Barcelona between 2005-2009. I participated two research projects. The first 
	one was to design a power and thermal-aware microprocessor. I proposed and implemented several CPU microarchitecture 
	techniques such as thread migration, critical thread identificaiton and software-hardware co-designed steering techniques 
	for a clustered processor. The whole project won a Spanish technology award in 2008. The second project was to design 
	a programmable accelerator. I was the chief architect of the accelerator, and the accelerator was one of candidates for a video processor 
	being incorporated into Intel's Merrifield SoC.

    	<h2>Education</h2>
	<p>I did my PhD in University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia, between 2002-2006. The thesis title is profile-guided 
	redundancy elimination. The key contribution is the design and implemenation of a computionally optimal profile-guided 
	partial redundancy elimination (PRE). This is the first computionally optimal profile-guided PRE algorithm.</p>

	<p>I obtained my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (1st class Honours) from University of New South Wales in 2001.
	The title of Honours thesis is speculative partial redundancy elimination in dynamic compilation. I got my Bachelor
	of Mathematics and Bachelor of Computer Science (the double degree) from University of Wollongong in 2000.</p>
